                <p>Welcome to the deep end of decentralized fun. Poseidon, the mighty god of the sea in Greek mythology, was a central figure in ancient Greek culture and coinage. As one of the Twelve Olympians, Poseidon ruled over the oceans, wielding his iconic trident, which symbolized his power to create storms, earthquakes, and calm waters. He was also associated with horses, earning the title Poseidon Hippios.</p>
